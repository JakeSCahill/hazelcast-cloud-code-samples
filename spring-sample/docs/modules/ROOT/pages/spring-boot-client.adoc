== Context

The Spring Framework is a Java framework for creating standalone applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Spring Boot is a tool that makes it easier and faster to develop applications with the Spring Framework by providing  many features, including autoconfiguration.

If you're unfamiliar with Spring or Spring Boot, see the link:{url-spring-boot}[Spring Boot documentation].

== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A xref:cloud:ROOT:create-serverless-cluster.adoc[Serverless cluster].
- link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git]
- link:https://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven]
- JDK 8
- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set to the path of the JDK

== Step 1. Clone the Sample Project

All the code for this project is available on GitHub. In this step, you'll clone the project and learn how it works.

. Clone the GitHub repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-code-samples.git

cd hazelcast-cloud-code-samples/spring-sample

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-code-samples.git

cd hazelcast-cloud-code-samples/spring-sample
```

====

. Open the `spring-sample/src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

. Add connection credentials for your cluster to the `application.properties` file. You can find these credentials in the {hazelcast-cloud} console under *Connect Client* > *Advanced Setup*.
+
- `clusterName`
- `discoveryToken`
- `keyStorePassword`
- `trustStorePassword` (same as `keyStorePassword`)

. Download the keystore and truststore files from the {hazelcast-cloud} console and add them to the `spring-sample/src/main/resources` directory. You can find these files in the {hazelcast-cloud} console under *Connect Client* > *Advanced Setup*.

The sample code for this tutorial is in the link:{github-directory}[`hazelcast-cloud-code-samples/spring-sample`] directory.

.`pom.xml`
[%collapsible]
====
If the Hazelcast client is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot automatically configures a `HazelcastInstance` that you can inject into your application.

.`HzViridianDemoApplication.java`
[%collapsible]
====
Spring Boot first attempts to create a Hazelcast client by checking the presence of a `com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig` bean. This bean is configured using the information in the `application.properties` file.

[source,java]

include::spring-sample:example$src/main/java/sample/com/hazelcast/demo/viridian/HzViridianDemoApplication.java[tag=class]
----

link:{github-directory}/src/main/java/sample/com/hazelcast/demo/viridian/HzViridianDemoApplication.java[View source]
====

.`MapService.java`
[%collapsible]
====
When the `com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig` bean is present, a `HazelcastInstance` is injected into the application classes. This instance is a Hazelcast client with an established connection to the {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

----

link:{github-directory}/src/main/java/sample/com/hazelcast/demo/viridian/MapService.java[View source]
====

== Step 2. Connect the Client

In the `spring-sample` directory, execute the following:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The client connects to the cluster and adds 10 random entries to a map called `MyMap`.

```
...
Authenticated with server
...
Map prepopulated [mapName=MyMap,size=10]
...
BUILD SUCCESS
```

== Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up a Spring Boot application to connect to a {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

== Next Steps

Use this boilerplate application as a foundation to start building your own application.
